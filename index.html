 Castle Made of Sand
<p>So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand</p>
 <p>When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land</p>
<p>Reach from my hand</p>
<p>I sacrificed my life to give you my life to speakers</p>
<p>I tried to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus</p>
<p>God knows I got a good heart but my blood's been with demons</p>
<p>I'm fighting myself, believe me, I'm far from ignorant</p>
<p>Far from greedy if you knew what I come from</p>
<p>Knew what I've been through, you think there shoulda</p>
<p>Been another outcome just like most kids</p>
<p>A father, I did it without one</p>
<p>Come from the city where they X you like Malcom</p>
<p>Then you wonder how come I can move in the room</p>
<p>Full of woos, so sweet, so smooth</p>
<p>Thank you mom for making me a man</p>
<p>Let 'em mother fucker knock down my castle in the sand</p>
<p>So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand</p>
<p>When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land</p>
<p>Reach from my hand</p>
<p>Reach for my hand</p>
<p>I live my whole life with the world on my shoulders</p>
<p>So I couldn't care less what this music game throws us</p>
<p>I see them looking in front of ? , but they won't find it</p>
<p>I come from struggle, I am a fighter, must you be reminded</p>
<p>My mother's past has a trap, has a blinded</p>
<p>But I took her past, I took her pain</p>
<p>I made it strength, I fought the game,</p>
<p>Do or die, Pitbull's the name</p>
<p>Now all I see is the future, mom, I love you, I salute you</p>
<p>Then no matter what happens jusst you're the reason I am rappin'</p>
<p>Look I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple</p>
<p>Came down to south beach to build a new castle</p>
<p>Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle</p>
<p>Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to</p>
<p>Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner</p>
<p>I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla</p>
<p>I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture</p>
<p>Kid hit the switch, I promise to never switch up</p>
<p>This is for my brother took three and went to jail</p>
<p>I'm sending all my pictures through the mail</p>
<p>He hit me with a letter, I know you'll never fail</p>
<p>So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail</p>
<p>So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand</p>
<p>When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land</p>
<p>Reach from my hand</p>
<p>Reach for my hand</p>
